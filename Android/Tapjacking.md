#### Tapjacking is the Android-app equivalent of the clickjacking web vulnerability.
##### Maybe you think that the vulnerable app to tapjacking, on that app any app can be overlayed, however it is that the vulnerable app can be overlayed on any app.
##### E.g. Like a bancking app is vulnerable so we can overlap trasfer money feature on another app with transpiracy to zero and on malicious app can add button like click me at same position, but in relality it will click on transfer money button placed over it.

On Android 10+, tapjacking is mitigated by default (taps pass through fully transparent overlays).
